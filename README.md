# Hello-Dimeji
This is for my up coming boot camp. How exciting to be here.

I am in the process of becoming a developer for the purpose of creating a new identity for myself. I have been trying to learn about coding by myself for a while and it is working out to be very slow. The thing i that if you do not have a project you have in mind to build or create it will be difficult for you to see any level of achievement. You learning would just be perpetual.

I thought that this year i have to take matters to another level and get more results faster and more deliberately.
