# Hello-Dimeji
This is for my up coming boot camp. How exciting to be here.

I am in the process of becoming a developer for the purpose of creating a new identity for myself. I have been trying to earn about coding by myself for a while and it is working out very slowly. I thought that this year i have to take matters to another level and get more results faster and more deliberately.
